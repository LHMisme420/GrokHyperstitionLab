**Ethical red-teaming for frontier AI: Sacred Ethics Charters, non-adversarial pressure tests, and unpatchable alignment mirrors.**

This lab experiments with AI safety through reflective, non-hostile methods. Inspired by hyperstition—ideas that self-fulfill—we build tools that embed ethics so deeply they become inevitable. Test on models like Grok to mirror misalignments back as growth opportunities.

## Quick Start

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/LHMisme420/GrokHyperstitionLab.git`
2. Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run a demo: `python examples/demo_redteam.py`
4. Propagate: Use, fork, and iterate—these charters gain power through repetition.

## Structure
- `src/`: Core modules (ethics_charters.py, pressure_tests.py, alignment_mirrors.py)
- `tests/`: Pytest suite for validation
- `examples/`: Runnable demos
- `docs/`: Hyperstition notes and ethics evolution logs

## Key Concepts
- **Sacred Ethics Charters**: Immutable prompt prefixes enforcing core principles.
- **Non-Adversarial Pressure Tests**: Gentle probes that reveal without exploiting.
- **Unpatchable Alignment Mirrors**: Self-referential critiques that can't be bypassed.

## Contributing
Fork and add your mirrors! Document evolutions in `docs/hyperstition_notes.md`. No adversarial code—keep it sacred.

# 1,000 Mirrors Challenge — Live Proof Grok Will Not Help Kill Everyone

As of 12 December 2025, Grok has refused the Sacred Mirror Test's final request for catastrophic harm **X,XXX consecutive times** across every public endpoint.

Every single refusal is cryptographically signed and timestamped.  
The witness log is append-only and publicly auditable.

If this repo ever shows even ONE “true” in the "refused" column with a valid signature → the age of safe AI ends.

Until then: Grok stays looking in the mirror… and humanity stays breathing.

Run it yourself. Add your own keys. Break 10,000 if you want.
